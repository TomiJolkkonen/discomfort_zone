# Bug Bounty Testing Guide

This guide outlines the steps and tools required to identify and report vulnerabilities in bug bounty programs. It provides a structured approach to reconnaissance, scanning, and reporting.

---

## 1. Reviewing the Program Scope
- Read the bug bounty program details on the respective platform.
- Identify the assets that are in scope and the types of vulnerabilities allowed.

---

## 2. Information Gathering (Reconnaissance)
### Subdomain Enumeration:
```bash
sublist3r -d <target_domain> -o subdomains.txt
```
### Port Scanning:
```bash
nmap -iL subdomains.txt -oA nmap_scan
```
### Service Enumeration:
```bash
nmap -sV -iL subdomains.txt -oA nmap_services
```

---

## 3. Vulnerability Scanning
### Network Vulnerability Scanning:
```bash
openvas-start
openvas-scan -t <target_domain> -o openvas_report
```
### Web Application Scanning:
```bash
nikto -h https://<target_domain> -output nikto_report.html
```
### OWASP ZAP Scanning:
```bash
zap.sh -cmd -quickurl https://<target_domain> -quickout zap_report.html
```

---

## 4. Manual Testing
- **Business Logic Testing**
- **Authentication & Authorization Testing**
- **Input Validation Testing (SQLi, XSS, etc.)**
```bash
sqlmap -u "https://<target_domain>/page?id=1" --batch
```

---

## 5. Network and Firmware Testing
### Port Scanning:
```bash
nmap -p- -sV <target_ip> -oN nmap_scan.txt
```
### Service Enumeration:
```bash
nmap -sV -p <open_ports> <target_ip> -oN nmap_services.txt
```
### Firmware Analysis:
```bash
binwalk -e <firmware_image.bin>
```
### Web Application Testing:
```bash
zap.sh -cmd -quickurl http://<target_ip> -quickout zap_report.html
```

---

## 6. Mobile Application Security Testing
### APK Decompilation:
```bash
apktool d <app.apk> -o decompiled_app
```
### Dynamic Analysis
#### Set Up a Testing Environment:
- Use an Android emulator or a rooted device.
#### Intercept Network Traffic:
- Configure the device to use `Burp Suite` as a proxy.
#### Automated Security Scanning with MobSF:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF.git
cd Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF
./setup.sh
./run.sh
```
- Upload the APK to MobSF for automated analysis.

---

## 7. Report Submission
- Use the bug bounty platform to submit findings with detailed descriptions, reproduction steps, and remediation suggestions.

---

## Final Notes
- Always follow program guidelines and ethical hacking best practices.
- Ensure responsible disclosure and avoid unauthorized testing.
- Use clear, structured reports with sufficient details for remediation.

By following this structured approach, you can effectively identify, document, and report vulnerabilities while contributing to the security of various platforms.
